Consider an environment in which our agent requires caffeine to
function\footnote{If it helps you can think of the agent as a graduate
  student.}. Because caffeine is so important to our agent, we would
like the agent to find a policy that will always lead it to
the shortest path to coffee. Once the agent reaches coffee, it
will stick around and enjoy it.

In order to apply optimal control techniques such as value
iteration and policy iteration, we first need to model this
scenario as an MDP. Recall that an MDP is defined as tuple
$(S, A, P, R, \gamma)$, where:
\begin{description}
\item[$S$:] The (finite) set of all possible states.
\item[$A$:] The (finite) set of all possible actions.
\item[$P$:] The transition function $P: S \times S \times A \to [0, 1]$, 
  which maps $(s', s, a)$ to $P(s'|s, a)$, i.e., 
  the probability of transitioning to state $s'\in S$ when taking action
  $a\in A$ in state $s\in S$. 
  Note that $\sum _{s' \in S} P(s' | s, a) = 1$ for all 
  $s \in S, a \in A$.
\item[$R$:] The reward function $R : S \times A \times S \to \mathbb R$,
which maps $(s, a, s')$ to $R(s, a, s')$, i.e., 
the reward obtained when taking action $a \in A$ in state $s \in S$ and 
arriving at state $s' \in S$.
\item[$\gamma$:] The discount factor, which controls how important are 
  rewards in the future. We have $\gamma \in [0, 1)$, where smaller values 
  mean more discounting for future rewards.
\end{description}

In order to encode this problem as an MDP, we need to define each of
the components of the tuple for our particular problem. 
Note that there may be many different possible encodings.

For the questions, in this section, consider the instance shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:prob1_shortest_path_domain}. In the figure, the agent
is at $(1,1)$, but it can start at any of
the grid cells. The goal, displayed as a coffee cup, is
located at $(6,6)$. The agent is able to move one square up, down,
left and right (deterministically). Walls are represented by thick black
lines. The agent cannot move through walls. All actions are available in
all states. If the agent attempts to move through a wall, 
it will remain in the same state.

When the agent reaches the coffee cup, the episode ends. Another way to
think of this, is that every action in the coffee cup state, keeps the
agent in the coffee cup state.

\subsection*{Part a (10pt)}

For this section, assume we are modeling the MDP as an infinite
horizon MDP. The coffee cup is still an absorbing state.

Using the above problem description answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item  How many states are in this MDP? (i.e. what is $|S|$). \yl{36}
\item How many actions are in this MDP? (i.e. what is $|A|$). \yl{4}
\item What is the dimensionality of the transition function $P$? \yl{36*4=144}
\item Fill in the probabilities for the transition function $P$.\\
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline
      \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{} &
                               \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{\textbf{s'}}\\\hline
      \textbf{s} & \textbf{a} & (1,2) & (1,1) & (1,4) & (1,3) & (5, 6)\\\hline
      (1,1) & up & 1& 0& 0& 0&0\\ \hline
      (1,1) & down& 0& 1& 0&0&0\\ \hline
      (1,3) & up & 0& 0& 0& 1&0\\ \hline
      (6,6) & left & 0& 0& 0& 0&0\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

\item Describe a reward function $R : S \times A \times S$ 
  and a value of $\gamma$ that
  will lead to an optimal policy giving the shortest path to the coffee cup from
  all states.
  
  \yl{R((5,6),right,(6,6))=1\\
  R((6,5),up,(6,6))=1\\
 and other R(S,A,S)=0\\
 $\gamma$ = 0.9}
\item Does $\gamma \in (0, 1)$ affect the optimal policy in this case?
  Explain why.
  \yl{No. Because when $0 < gamma < 1$, the optimal policy would always be the shortest path. }
\item How many possible policies are there?  (\textbf{All policies},
  not just optimal policies.)
  \yl{$4^{36}$}
\item What is the optimal policy? Draw the grid and label each cell
  with an arrows in the direction of the optimal action. If multiple
  arrows, include the probability of each arrow. There may be
  multiple optimal policies, pick one and show it.

\item Is your policy deterministic or stochastic? \yl{deterministic}
\item Is there any advantage to having a stochastic policy? Explain. \yl{In this case, not much advantage. But in some settings, stochastic policy might have advantages of a) in adversarial setting, where your enemy cannot learn you policy easily, b) if the environment is stochastic, stochastic policy might be better, c) partial observable settings, stochastic policy might be better.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part b (2pt)}

Now consider that our agent often goes the wrong direction because of
how tired it is. Now each action has a $10\%$ chance of going
perpendicular to the left of the direction chosen and $10\%$ chance of
going perpendicular to the right of the direction chosen. Given this
change answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Fill in the values for the transition function $P$.\\
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|c|c|}\hline
      \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{} &
                               \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{s'}}\\\hline
      \textbf{s} & \textbf{a} & (1,3) & (3,2) & (1,4)\\\hline
      (2,2) & up & 0& 0.1& 0\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\item Does the optimal policy change compared to Part~a? Justify your
  answer. \yl{It will change. For example, right would be the optimal action rather than up in (4,3).}
\item Will the value of the optimal policy change? Explain. \yl{It will change because the environment is actually changed}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part c (4pt)}

Now consider a deterministic MDP, like in Part~a. But this time, the
agent has a meeting with their adviser in 5 minutes. So they need a
policy that optimizes getting the coffee in that time limit. We will
model this as an episodic MDP.

Consider the case where each step takes 1 minute to execute.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Problem 2}

In this problem you will program value iteration and policy
iteration. You will use environments implementing the OpenAI Gym
Environment API. For more information on the Gym and the API see:
\url{https://gym.openai.com/}. We will be working with different
versions of the FrozenLake
environment~\footnote{\url{https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0}}.

In this domain the agent starts at a fixed starting position, marked
with ``S''. The agent can move up, down, left and right. In the
deterministic versions, the up action will always move the agent up,
the left will always move left, etc. In the stochastic versions, the
up action will move up with probability $1/3$, left with probability $1/3$
and right with probability $1/3$.

There are three different tile types: frozen, hole, and goal. When the
agent lands on a frozen tile it receives $0$ reward. When the agent
lands on a hole tile it receives $0$ reward and the episode ends. When
the agent lands on the goal tile it receives $+1$ reward and the episode
ends. We have provided you with two different maps.

States are represented as integers numbered from left to right, top to
bottom starting at zero. So the upper left corner of the 4x4 map is
state $0$, and the bottom right corner of the 4x4 map is state $15$.

You will implement value iteration and policy iteration using the
provided environments. You may use either Python 2.7 or Python 3. Some
function templates are provided for you to fill in. Specific coding
instructions are provided in the source code files.

\textbf{Note:} Be careful implementing value iteration and policy
evaluation. Keep in mind that in this environment the reward function
depends on the current state, the current action, and the \textbf{next
state}. Also terminal states are slightly different. Think about the
backup diagram for terminal states and how that will affect the
Bellman equation.

\subsection*{Coding (30 pt)}

Implement the functions in the code template. Then answer the questions below
using your implementation.

\item Using value iteration, find the optimal value function. Record
  the time taken for execution and the number of iterations required. Use a
  stopping tolerance of $10^{-3}$. Use $\gamma=0.9$. \yl{For 4x4:
  Time: 0.0039s, number of iterations: 23}
  
  \yl{For 8x8:
  Time: 0.0143s, number of iterations: 24}
\item Plot the value function as a color map like in Part~a. Is the
  value function different compared to the deterministic versions of
  the maps?
  \yl{Yes. It's different.}

\item Does the optimal policy differ from the optimal policy in the 
  deterministic map? 
  If so pick a state where the policy differs and explain why the action is
  different. \yl{Yes. For example, in the 8x8 map, the (7,1) state is Down, but for deterministic version, it is Right. This might due to the fact if you choose right and happened to slip, if would go to left, which is bad. But if you choose Down, if it's slip, it can happened to slip to the goal state. If it is not slip, it can remain in the original stae.}
\item Write an agent that executes the optimal policy. Run this agent
  $100$ times on the map and record the total cumulative discounted
  reward. Average the results. Does this value match the value
  computed for the starting state? If not explain why. \yl{for 4x4, it is 0.06968, and value computed is 0.0642. For 8x8, it is 0.00793, and the value computed is 0.00232. They didn't match. It might because the process is stochastic, so the variance is actually big.}

\subsection*{Part c (4 pt)}

We have provided one more version of the frozen lake environment. Now
the agent receives a $-1$ reward for landing on a frozen tile, $0$
reward for landing on a hole, and $+1$ for landing on the goal.

Answer these questions for map \texttt{Deterministic-4x4-neg-reward-FrozenLake-v0}.

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Using value iteration, find the optimal value function. Use a
  stopping tolerance of $10^{-3}$. Use $\gamma=0.9$. Plot the
  value function as a color map like in Part~a.
  \yl{This question is a little bit confusing. I assume that the hole and the goal still means end of the episode. The color is plotted as following.}

\item Is the value function different from the other deterministic 4x4 map? \yl{Yes. It is different.}
\item Convert the value function to the optimal policy and include it
  in the writeup. \yl{As following}

\item Is the policy different from the other deterministic 4x4 map? If
  so, pick a state where it differs and explain why the action is different. \yl{Yes. For example, row 1, col 2, it is Down, in order to go to the hole to end the episode in order to avoid losing more scores. But in non-negative version, it is Right, in order to go to the goal state.}

\section*{Problem 3 (10pt)}

In this problem you will practice implementing an environment. Given
the following environment description implement an OpenAI Gym
environment that matches the specifications.

You have a server which contains three queues. Each queue can contain
up to five items. At every timestep the server is currently working on
a specific queue. The server starts the environment on queue 1. The
server has four actions: service an item from the current queue,
switch to queue 1, switch to queue 2, switch to queue 3. Servicing an
item from the queue when there is an item present gives a reward of
+1. When the queue is empty no reward is given. Switching queues gives
no rewards.

After each action each queue has a probability of receiving a new
item: $P1$, $P2$, and $P3$ for queue 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

Implement this environment with the following sets of probabilities:
  
\begin{itemize}
\item $P1 = 0.1$, $P2 = 0.9$, $P3 = 0.1$
\item $P1 = 0.1$, $P2 = 0.1$, $P3 = 0.1$
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem 4 (10pt)}

Consider an MDP $M = (S, A, P, R, \gamma)$, where the components of 
$M$ are as described in Problem $1$. In this problem, we will study some properties
of value iteration. The Bellman optimality equation for the 
optimal value function $V ^* : S \to \mathbb R$, 
which we also write $V ^* \in \mathbb R ^S$, is
\begin{align*}
  V ^*(s) = \max _{a \in A} 
    \left(
      \sum _{s' \in S} 
        P(s' | s, a) \left(
          R (s, a, s') + \gamma V ^*( s' )
        \right)
    \right) .
\end{align*}
Define the Bellman optimality operator 
$\mathcal F ^* : \mathbb R ^{ S } \to \mathbb R ^{ S }$ as 
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal F ^* V (s) 
    = \max _{a \in A} 
      \left(
        \sum _{s' \in S} 
          P(s' | s, a) \left(
            R (s, a, s') + \gamma V ( s' )
          \right)
      \right) ,
\end{align*}
where $\mathcal F ^* V (s)$ is shorthand for $( \mathcal F ^* ( V ) ) (s)$.
Note that $S$ is finite so value functions are essentially vectors in 
$\mathbb R ^{ |S| }$. The operator $\mathcal F ^*$ maps vectors in 
$\mathbb R ^{ |S| }$ to vectors in $\mathbb R ^{ |S| }$.

Value iteration amounts to repeated application of $\mathcal F ^*$ to an 
arbitrary initial value function $V _0 \in \mathbb R ^ { S }$. 
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
  \item Prove that $V ^*$ is an unique fixed point of $\mathcal F ^*$, i.e, 
    $\mathcal F ^* V ^* = V ^*$ and that if 
    $\mathcal F ^* V = V$ and $\mathcal F ^* V ' = V '$ 
    for two value functions $V, V' \in \mathbb R ^S$, 
    then $V = V'$, i.e., $V(s) = V'(s)$ for all $s \in S$.
  \item Prove that $(\mathcal F ^*) ^ k V _0$ converges to $V ^*$ as $k \to \infty$
    for any $V _0 \in \mathbb R ^ S$. 
    Consider convergence in max-norm. The max-norm of a vector 
    $u \in \mathbb R ^d $ is defined as  
    ${ || u || } _\infty = \max _{i \in \{1, \ldots, d \} }{ | u _i | }$. 
  \item Given the optimal value function $V ^*$ 
    write down the expression that recovers the optimal policy $\pi ^*$ as a 
    function of $V ^*$ and the parameters of $M$.
    \footnote{Actually, such a procedure works for any value function $V \in \mathbb R ^S$. 
    This procedure is called policy extraction.}
