Exploration Strategies for Deep Reinforcement Learning

I plan to explore the exploration strategies for DRL to overcome sparse reward games such as MONTEZUMA's REVENGE and PITFALL.
PITFALL is actually unsolved and all current models resulting in pessimistic behaviors (e.g., jumping around the starting point)

I'll first run baselines of Dueling DQN and A3C on Montezuma's Revenge and PITFALL. Here are the baselines:

I'll implemented counter-based approach on both tasks.

I'll try my approach on that.
